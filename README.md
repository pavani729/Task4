## 📝 How It Works

1. Form contains four input fields: **Name**, **Email**, **Phone**, and **Message**
2. JavaScript listens to all inputs using `input` event
3. If all fields are valid:
   - ✅ Error messages disappear
   - ✅ Submit button is **enabled**
4. If any field is invalid:
   - ❌ Error message is shown
   - ❌ Submit button is **disabled**
5. On successful submission:
   - 🎉 Success message is shown
   - 🔁 Form resets and submit button is disabled again
